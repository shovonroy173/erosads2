        <p className="text-[14px] text-[#9b9b9b] !mb-8 text-xs">
          We offer a wide variety of advertising options. Most advertisers start
          with a standard ad or visiting ad, and then customize their ads with
          such options as VIP upgrades or Premier Services to drive even more
          traffic to them. Both standard and visiting ads include an elegant
          full page ad with up to 8 photos.

          By purchasing an ad on the Eros Guide, you have secured a beautifully
          laid-out advertisement on the premier website for adult entertainment
          services. Since 1997 we have been dedicated to bringing you high

          we cannot guarantee you a specific number of leads from your
          advertisement. But we do know what it takes to maintain great site
          traffic – both quality and quantity – and what types of things you can
          do to take maximum advantage of that traffic. Which is why at Eros you
          have access to the best customer service and sales staff in the
          industry. We are here to answer your questions and help you make the
          most of your advertising experience with the Eros Guide.
